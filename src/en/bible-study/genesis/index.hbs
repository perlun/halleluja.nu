### Introduction

Genesis, or "the first book of Moses" as it is also called, describes the history of mankind, from creation through the stories of Noah's Ark unto God's calling of Abram to become a father of many nations. After that, the book puts a great emphasis on the history of God's elect people - the children of Israel (i.e. Jacob), all the way to the wonderful story of Joseph and how his faithful holding on to God's promises helped rescue his whole family from famine.

### Authorship

The traditional view is that the book of Genesis was written by Moses, the leader that God chose to rescue his people from the bondage in Egypt at circa 1400-1500 B.C. In our modernist age, where everything tends to be questioned to the level of absurdity, various theories have been put forth which questions this view and proposes various fanciful theories.

There is little reason to pay much (if any at all) attention to this speculation, since the Mosaic authorship of the books of Moses is so widely attested to by Jesus (Mark 12:26 talks about "the book of Moses", referring to Genesis specifically), John the Apostle (Joh 1:17, speaking about the law as "given by Moses"), Peter (Acts 3:22, referring to a quote from Deut 18:15 as "Moses truly said"), and so forth. We can choose to believe the speculation of the modernists, or we can choose to believe the testimony as given by Jesus and his apostles. I personally consider them - Jesus and his friends - a much more reliable source in this regard.
