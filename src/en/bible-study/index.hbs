In this section of the site, we are aiming for a more comprehensive study of God's Word to mankind, the Bible. The Bible studies are separated by book, and the listing for each book is separated by chapter.

It is my personal aim to, at some point, having gone through the whole Bible with you. There are _so many riches_ in God's Word; we really don't want to miss a single part of it.

As for the translation used in this effort, this is a tricky one. [Many Bible translations](https://christianity.stackexchange.com/questions/16377/what-major-translations-of-the-bible-are-in-the-public-domain) have copyright restrictions that make it hard to use in an effort like this. In the end, I am hoping to quote much more than the 250 or 500 verses provided by the licenses for some of these Bibles.

This doesn't leave us that many choices. ESV would be one option, but I personally have stronger feelings for the "good ole' KJV", the King James Version of the Bible. It was one of the very first bible translations I started reading in English after I got saved at the age of 20, and I like its slightly "majestic" style. The archaic language is not a big deal to me; it doesn't hurt to make the language of the Bible feel a bit more "old-school" than the way people talk today. The stories in it took place thousands of years ago, after all. If you dislike KJV, feel free to use whatever translation you feel more comfortable when reading along with me.

The Bible study section of this site is something considered a "work in progress", and will probably be in this state for many years go come (perhaps for the rest of my life). If there are particular areas (books, chapters) that you would like to see covered soon, feel free to drop me a line! You can find my contact details on the [about](../about) page.

### Books of the Bible

The Bible as we know it (if you like, the "protestant Bible" as used by practically all Protestant churches in the world) contains 66 books. The Old Testament, consisting of 39 books, describes the history of God's relationship to mankind all the way from creation, through the slavery in Egypt and so forth, leading up to the events taking place in Israel (sometimes called "Palestine") at around the time of the beginning of our era - the birth of Jesus Christ, the Messiah, born of the Virgin as a Savior to mankind.

The 27 books of the New Testament depicts the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, and the life of the early Church and its challenges. It also contains some very important books which describes the Christian doctrine more in detail, particularly the _life in Christ_ which Paul the Apostle puts a great emphasis on explaining to the reader. Many other important topics are also covered. The New Testament and the Bible altogether ends with a _grande finale_ - the book of Revelation, which is clearly one of the most challenging books of the Bible to comprehend. It describes the events which will take place at the end of this age, culminating with the return of Jesus Christ and the ultimate doom and judgement of Satan, his angels, and everybody who belongs to him.

In addition to the Old and New Testaments, there are also some so-called "apocryphal books" (called "deuterocanonical" in the Roman Catholic Church). While they can serve a certain purpose in getting a better understanding of the time between the end of the Old Testament canon and the birth of Jesus, I agree with Martin Luther's view on these books:

> Apocrypha: These books are not held equal to the Sacred Scriptures, and yet are useful and good for reading

For the time being, I don't consider these books important enough to include in the Bible study we are conducting here. It seems more important to focus on the actual books we believe to be inspired by the Holy Ghost, i.e. the canonical books listed below.

Finally, a note about the format of this web site: Only the books where there is actual content are linked below. In other words, for books where the name of the book cannot be clicked on, I have not yet written any content. Likewise with chapters - numbers that cannot be clicked on indicate that there is not yet any content. Stay tuned for updates. They will be posted to [our Twitter account](https://twitter.com/hallelujanu).
