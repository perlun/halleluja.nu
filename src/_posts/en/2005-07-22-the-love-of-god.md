<em>The Love of God</em> is probably one of the most important things that you get a clear revelation on. Why is this so important? 1 John 4:8 says it all. <em>"He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love."</em>

Now, there is something we must clearly define before we start digging real deep into the scripture. <em>What is love? What is its definition?</em> Well, like most things it can mean a great many things. In the greek language, there's even three words for three different kinds of love: <em>agape</em> (the love of God, which we are going to talk about here), <em>phileo</em> (the love between two friends) and <em>eros</em> (erotic love. This one is not even used in the bible). So, what is this agape kind of love? It is an outgiving, non-selfish kind of love. It is the kind of love that makes you ignore your own needs for the sake of someone else. This is exactly what Jesus did when he died for all people at the cross of Calvary.

We get a very clear revelation of this in John 3:16: <em>"For God so loved (agapao) the world that He gave his only begotten son, that whosoever who believeth should not perish but have everlasting life."</em> God loves all men &mdash; and he proved this once and for all by giving his own Son to die for you, since only his death could pay the price for our sin.

In fact, the ultimate proof of love is to die for your friends (John 15:13). The absolutely fantastic thing is that this is not where the story ends. That God loves us is indeed a great thing. But this love, the agape-love, has been imparted into <em>us</em> as believers! Read 2 Peter 1:4. If you do not know this verse from before, it says that we have been made partakers of the divine nature. Now, we must get this in a very balanced way. Being a partaker of divine nature does not mean that we are almighty God! There is one triune God, and that's not me or you. But he has imparted his own nature, or his way of doing things, into us as believers. This is stunning. I can hardly grasp it.

In Ephesians 2:3, Paul says that we were <em>"by nature the children of wrath"</em>. But, praise God, when we were born-again, born by an incorruptible seed (1 Pet 1:23), we received a new nature &mdash; the nature of God. This was an absolutely amazing revelation for me. How could a sinner be transformed into a child of God, with the nature of God, just like that? It goes beyond human understanding &mdash; but it's the reality.

What is this divine nature? Well, it is love among other things. We have had God's own nature, the ability to love people with agape love, imparted into our own spirits. 1John 4:7 says <em>"Beloved, let us love one another"</em>. The word used for <em>"love"</em> here is agapao. God has made it possible for us to love with his own love, something that was (and still is) completely impossible for the old creation. Let us use this fact and love our neighbour as ourselves! It's absolutely possible.
