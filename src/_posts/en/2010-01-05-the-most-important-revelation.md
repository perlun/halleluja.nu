Recently, the Lord reminded me of something important, something I think we all need to be reminded of at times.


He reminded me that he loves me.

Let me a bit bold here: I believe that the revelation that God is love, and not only that, but that he loves <em>me personally</em>, is <em>the</em> most important revelation on planet Earth.

This truth &ndash; when you get a glimpse of it with your spiritual eyes &ndash; comes with absolute dynamite power, changing your very circumstance right where you are. Darkness is turned into light. Hatred and vengeance in your personal relationships are turned into friendship and loving care for each other. And, perhaps the most important thing of them all, <em>fear</em> is changed into <em>faith</em> in the Lord Jesus Christ.

The Word says, in 1 Joh 4:18: <em>"There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear has torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love."</em>

Do you see it? There <em>is</em> no fear in love. When the love of God comes into your heart, it cannot co-exist with fear. So, what happens? It literally <em>casts out</em> the fear that Satan ultimately has placed there, trying to keep you bondage for the rest of your life if he just could. Instead comes the love of God, the very expression of God\'s character. Can there be something more beautiful? I doubt it.

My prayer when writing these final words to you, my precious, precious reader, is that you would receive His love today.

In Jesus\' Name, Amen.
